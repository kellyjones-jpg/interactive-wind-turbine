# Interactive Wind Turbine
An [interactive wind energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt3YLawaaRM) simulation built in Processing that responds to mouse movement to control wind intensity and turbine performance. The sketch features real-time power output calculations, dynamic blade rotation speeds, and atmospheric audio feedback using the Minim library.

Key technical implementations include Perlin noise for organic terrain and cloud movement, array-based speed tracking for blade rotation data, and conditional audio playback that activates above wind intensity thresholds. Visual elements combine NREL Image Gallery photography with Photoshop-generated stratus clouds, creating an immersive renewable energy visualization.

The project demonstrates creative coding techniques including loops for cloud rendering, transparency effects, bezier curves for wind visualization, and smooth randomness through Perlin noise functions—resulting in a naturalistic, engaging representation of wind power generation.
